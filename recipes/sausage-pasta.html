        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            The flavors brought together by this recipe are truly incredible. It has sweet &
            spicy sausage, roasted red peppers, spinach, and a rich garlic Parmesan sauce. A
            white wine reduction and softened cream cheese also add even more flavor and texture
            to the dish. This one is most certainly a must-try at home.

                        mustard powder, onion powder, and Italian seasoning and set aside.

                Cut the sausage into 1/2-inch thick slices. Heat 6 tablespoons water over medium
                heat in a large, high-walled skillet. Add the sausage. Cover and cook for 
                10 minutes, stirring halfway through. Remove lid and increase heat slightly, 
                cook until browned, 5-7 minutes. Remove and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Carefully drain excess grease from pan but leave brown remnants. Add the white 
                wine, tomato paste, and garlic to the pan and set to medium heat. Use a silicone 
                spatula to “clean” the bottom of the pot. Let it bubble gently until reduced by 
                half, about 4 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the chicken broth and seasonings. Stir in the heavy cream. Bring to a boil, 
                then reduce to a simmer. Add the roasted red peppers and stir in the softened 
                cream cheese.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let the sauce bubble gently while you boil the pasta to al dente. 
                Don't overcook. Drain once cooked.
            </li>
            <li>
                Reduce sauce heat to low. Gradually sprinkle in the Parmesan cheese, stirring 
                continuously to incorporate. Add the spinach and the sausage along with any 
                juices from the plate. Add the cooked pasta and stir to combine.
            </li>
            <li>
                Garnish with fresh parsley and red pepper flakes and serve.
